# DnD5eRandomGenerator
A random encounter/event/item/NPC generator for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition

This project is meant to ease the burden of inventing random encounters, events, items, NPCs, etc. for the DM so they can
  focus their efforts on other aspects of the game. The DM can us as much or as little of the generator as they want, either
  staying true to what it puts out and implementing it in it's whole, or just using the generator for inspiration.


Uses:
  This project can be used in part or in whole to help you run your Dungeons and Dragons games more efficiently.

How to get started:
  Until better functionality can be implemented, download the DnD5RandGen folder and open the index.html file in chrome.


About the authors:
  This project is developed by a group, but currently I am in charge of backing it up.
